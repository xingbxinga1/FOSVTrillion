<meta name="description" content="If you are interested in interdisciplinary studies, I recommend you try 

Harvard History of Philosophy of Science

Stanford design learning and technology

Johns Hopkins steam

Duke University design own major

UCL PPE MA

These can basically achieve the intersection of three disciplines

Based on my practical experience in the top 50, 30, and 10 schools in the world over the years, basically the top 10 can achieve three interdisciplinary cross-disciplines, and the top 30 can achieve two. 

Stanford Closed Loop University 2025 will be better. 

Of course, if you are interested in more, you can try the Santa Fe Institute, Hofstadter, Michel, the author of Guns, Steel, and Germs, the Silicon Valley gang, and the two peaks of value investing.

Of course, my life experience is quite strange. My freshman requirement is ten subjects (Emoji! Emoji！ Emoji！) So I can't solve the problem by entering school. There is no ready-made answer.

I just dropped out of school like Charlie Munger and Elon Musk. I will do it by myself and create it myself (cry! cry! cry!)

How to use subject definite who definite subject？

How to use past subject Create who Create future subject？

|

Name Hilbert Munger

Male, 28 years old

Style: Polymath, encyclopedia, lollapalooza, The Tao of Munger, Value Invest
Have My Own Library，Mutipile Mental Models，Poor Charlies Almanack

|

30000h➕，13500books➕，100 Mental Models➕，10subjects➕，3 lifetime partners，72 edition poor Charlie almanack

|

Like Munger, Buffett, and Musk, I visited the library at the age of 6-12, and built my own library, multiple thinking models, and disciplines at the age of 18-21.

|

A freshman needs to integrate ten subjects, but Stanford only has three in the ninth year. No one can teach me, so I have to do it myself like Munger. I will do it by myself.

20-28 Abandoning degrees from Stanford and Harvard to focus on creating a Poor Charlie's Almanack

After I put this into practice, I saw a man named Munger who had the same idea as me and had been doing it for a hundred years. I was very happy.



I can guarantee that:

1.100% original, I first thought about the problem and practiced it myself, and then I found someone who thought in the same frequency as me after I succeeded, and then I found Munger

2. Analyze the trillion-level generalists, and use the Feynman learning method to reduce it to a level that ordinary people can understand

3. Abandoned degrees from Stanford and Harvard, and spent eight years focusing on creating my own Poor Charlie's Almanack. I can't understand it if I can't create it

4. For the analysis of generalists and outliers, I am a practitioner rather than an academic - I also practiced and succeeded in this path. I am a natural encyclopedia school. I started to build my own library in my freshman year, and I have a multiple mental model。">
