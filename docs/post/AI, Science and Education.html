<meta name="description" content="I have said this in 2017. If you don't believe me, read my previous six questions about AI and my analysis of human-computer interaction with Elon Musk. Ren Zhengfei and Jack Ma have also said similar things. If you can't compete with machines by learning machines, what are you learning? You learn in vain. The test machines are really rubbish. Do you think that you can only take tests and be useful?

I knew how bad this was in 2017, because I have a clear view of China's education problems, a bunch of inefficient, meaningless, and repetitive. When faced with the impact of almost free AI, with richer information flow than you - others have a database of tens of billions of information, and their labor is cheaper than yours - you have to pay tens of thousands of yuan a month while others do it for free, how can you beat them? Kai-Fu Lee talked about this issue in 'AI Future', and the replacement rate in developing countries is more than 80% - this is the prediction for 2017.

But I know that since most people have never thought independently - this proportion is considered low even if it is above 90% - the actual number may be even worse, 99%, basically less than one thousandth of them can really think independently. So, once the AI ​​upgrades and impacts, how can you fight it?

Most people are complacent and think that the world is vast. Ordinary people think that they have studied for 20 years, including 6 years in primary school, 6 years in middle school, 4 years in college, 3 years in graduate school and doctoral degree. The aristocratic families are complacent, for example, a certain person has a fifty-year network of connections - look at what you have achieved in 20 years, what Newton achieved in 20 years, what AI achieved in 20 years, really, you have learned nothing in 20 years, I really don't know where your confidence comes from?

You can do as Carter said to Morgana Liang Bing in 'Super Seminary', I have three thousand years, Liang Bing replied, I have thirty thousand years - and Principal Jilan's big clock of old time - one hundred thousand years. And AI training accumulates millions of years. I still don't know why they are living in a dream. This impact is unimaginable to them. It is beyond their cognitive circle and ability circle - by the way, I am one of the earliest Tencent video users who support 'Super Seminary Black Armor'. The first one to get into it was 'Lalala Demacia', including 'Fox Spirit Matchmaker' and 'SPY×FAMILY'. I am one of the first batch of people who really paid for it.

Do you know what I see - I saw this pattern ten years ago. It is similar to the disintegration of feudal farming by the rise of the bourgeoisie based on the underlying logic of gunpowder created by science, chemistry, mathematics and physics. The knight landlord class disintegrated the bronze and slash-and-burn agriculture two thousand years ago due to the acquisition of iron tools due to productivity. In the 17th century, the systematic scientific and technological revolution brought about by Newton's 'Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy' was forced to disintegrate. This moment is exactly like that moment. How could it be so similar?

If you have read Guns, Germs, you will know - that is the teacher of Yuval Noah Harari who wrote 'Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind'. You can learn more about it by reading Columbia Exchange for IELTS. How the landlord knight class disintegrated the feudal society a thousand years ago, and how the industrial revolution and steel disintegrated the knights five hundred years ago, what goes around comes around. A knight with a training period of twenty years, that is, it takes twenty years to train him, can be knocked down by one bullet - this is subversive content, you have twenty years, I have 2S, this exchange ratio is not proportional. This is because the differential variables are different, and then the integral is even more different, the gap is getting bigger and bigger - the density is different, the volume is different, the mass is different, p ✖ ️v＝m

The essence of revolutionary productivity explosion is disruptive innovation, and innovation comes from basic science. - In reverse, science brings innovation and innovation brings productivity. Whether it is the first scientific revolution in Britain that benefited from the scientific dividends of Newton, or Leibniz who was forced to go to France and brought calculus to France, or the influence of Euler's disciples Laplace and Lagrange on France - guess how Napoleon could quickly rise to power? He graduated from the artillery, a standard top student - if you want to be a king, learn calculus. And the chief French scientist is Laplace, a disciple of Euler.

Science and scientists have no borders. The essence is that my scientists are the world's top scientists, influencing the whole world. This is much more powerful than collecting monetary taxes. As long as it is in this field, you can't get around me - otherwise, what do you think the Nobel Prize is? That is a strategic-level scientist, with strategic influence for more than 30 to 50 years in the future, and the right to speak in the future.

How can it cover the whole world? Science brings technology, technology brings productivity, productivity generates interaction, and interaction affects more distant regions. This is radiation geopolitics.

The earliest application of calculus was to more accurately shove cannonballs into other people's asses and foreheads - for details, please refer to Napoleon. Of course, it is different now. Now it is all about shoving nuclear warheads into other people's asses from tens of thousands of kilometers away - of course, here we must consider the influence of large mass celestial bodies, planetary mass effects, and high-speed object effects - that is, relativity. Why do people always love Newton? If you understand, you will understand.

So the Industrial Revolution was started by Newton, so he was the first. Then the first, second, and even third industrial revolutions were laid by scientists, and then commercial infrastructure was formed, and then it was popularized to the public. The foundation of the public was the commercial foundation - the early stage of the third industrial revolution was the Internet computer and architecture, based on military content. The commercial foundation was science and technology - the Manhattan Project, including but not limited to Einstein, von Neumann, Oppenheimer, Feynman - of course Qian Xuesen was still a young man of the third generation at that time. The basic reserve of talents for the Manhattan Project came from the Third Solvay Conference - the Nobel Prize winners in pure physics, chemistry and biology - now you know how big the gap is, why do we need to have a theoretical foundation? You also know why the Nobel Prize has such a high status in the world. And what is the origin of the group of Nobel Prize winners back then? Mathematical physics all-rounders, Einstein, Hilbert, Poincare, von Neumann, Russell. Listen to who their disciples are: Planck, Bohr, Old Love, Feynman, Landau, Wittgenstein, Gödel, Turing, Shannon, Nash, Samuelson. To be honest, the third industrial revolution was really dominated by this family.

Guess who was responsible for the second industrial revolution and the first one? The second industrial revolution, electromagnetism, Faraday, Tesla, Franklin, Edison, radio, etc. And the origin of this revolution was Laplace, Lagrange, and Maxwell.

Who was the originator of the first industrial revolution? Diderot's Encyclopedia, and before that, Watt's improvements, etc. And before that, Newton, Leibniz, Descartes, Kepler, Galileo, etc.

Basic science is the foundation of the industrial revolution, the foundation of modern civilization, and the origin of modern times, so Newton and Einstein cannot be avoided.

In the late stage of the Second Industrial Revolution, Marx came to his senses and had an essential understanding of human civilization. He proposed the concepts of productivity, production relations and surplus value.

Then in the late third industrial revolution, now, well, the education system of the three hundred years of the industrial revolution, similar to the twenty years of knight training, has reappeared. This time it is not the knight master, but the college master, and he works in a job for decades. In the first industrial revolution and the early second industrial revolution, because the time rate of change of productivity was not too fast, only one job was needed for a lifetime, so there were not many changes. In the early third industrial revolution, the explosion of job demand in the 1960s-1990s hedged the risk, and the Internet dividend exploded. In the middle of the third industrial revolution, from the 1990s to the 2020s, the changes accelerated again, and the stability of a job, industry, and work was greatly weakened, so there were not enough jobs. The education system based on the second industrial revolution and the early third industrial revolution - an industry that can be maintained for a hundred years, which brought about industry jobs and stable majors, has disappeared.

I once asked my classmates when I was 18 years old-2013, what would you do if the current industry died? What if the elimination rate of your major is greater than the time of your job position? In other words, the last and most extreme case, before you graduate, or even while you are filling out your application, your major has been eliminated, what would you do? Even more ruthless, AI comes, what would you do if the thing you cultivated for 20 years is replaced by AI in 2 seconds and it is free? The cost gap is huge, you need 20 years of cost, but the income is not enough for others' 2SAI, to what extent will college students depreciate? Wake up from sleep at night, adults, the times have changed, what would you do?

You have to know that these college students who know nothing really know nothing. They don’t know what they know, nor do they know what they don’t know. They also don’t have the ability to think logically. However, AI mathematical logic is much better than college students. This is really a joke from hell.

The first to bear the brunt are those humanities and arts disciplines. Liu Cixin's short stories are the essence. If you learn about 'Poetry', you can always get a poem with infinite permutations and combinations - this is the earliest concept in infinite series. As long as you have infinite monkeys, you can type 'Shakespeare'. 'Entering the Immortal Cultivation' also talked about how to cultivate immortality scientifically.

So I don't understand why these people can remain indifferent to the 21st century, which is similar to the situation of the bourgeoisie when the knight class was declining. I don't understand but I am shocked. So I knew it when I was 18 years old. Before entering university, I had a clear understanding of the process of the world's industrial revolution, thanks to scientists such as Marx, Newton, Einstein, and Tesla, and also thanks to Silicon Valley fires such as Ellison, Larry Page, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates, as well as public lectures at Stanford, Harvard, and MIT.

The problem with Chinese students is that if you compete with machines and can only do questions, then you will definitely die, because you don’t have independent thinking. Once the machine comes, where can you escape? 2S bullets can kill knights, and 2S AI can also make college students lose their jobs, even before you get a job. If you learn to work like a machine, you will die suddenly in three days, and the machine can run for a hundred years - anyone who chooses to do questions like a machine will die faster the more they do, because you don’t know how to use tools. If you learn from machines but can’t compete with them, what’s the point?

This is low quality, low efficiency and meaningless repetition, and you are cheap. Because you don't think independently, you don't think independently, you think this way, he thinks this way, and all 1.4 billion people in China think this way, homogeneous, so naturally supply> demand - microeconomics common sense - of course, the microeconomics you learn and I learn are two different concepts. So, once the environmental capacity is limited and the demand is limited, guess what the result will be? That is a run, a run, there is no need for so much demand, but you supply so much, then naturally there is only cheap and free, the more you do, the more mistakes you make, because the direction is wrong.

Homogeneity and bank runs will inevitably lead to vicious competition and cheapness. In order to survive, this vicious cycle will inevitably lead to bad money driving out good money and adverse selection, that is, the quality of college students will be deteriorating to an incredible degree - you don’t think the world is isolated, do you? If every differential variable is bad, how can the whole be good?

So college students, professionals, industry practitioners, white-collar workers, it takes twenty years to come up, and now 2S has been destroyed by AI. 

The last time it was so exciting was the transition from agricultural productivity to industrial technological revolution productivity - that is, the feudal landlords became capitalist countries. It's really exciting. It's a true witness to history, of course all history is contemporary history

I suggest you play the 'Assassin's Creed' series and participate in it. There are a lot of historical celebrities.

Before the third industrial revolution, you could barely do this. But after the third industrial revolution, what can you do? AI doesn’t care about you. Your logical thinking ability is not as good as AI. How can you compete? Do you still need a test-taking machine? This is not because I actively avoided the test-taking machine in high school, but because I passively did not allow the test-taking machine to do so.

Well, the old prophet is here. In December 2022, Chat is out. These moats, bandwidth redundancy and buffers that you should have avoided in college and formed with college as your last chance, have been wasted. Naturally, there is no such opportunity.
If you ask me what education is, I will tell you that education is the ability to influence the future, define the power, and set prices. In other words, education is the ability to face the future. In financial terms, it is the ability to hedge and not depreciate. Nobel Prize winners have the power to set prices and define the future for the next fifty years. Of course, the same is true for business giants.

The world's number one country must dominate, or in other words, reap all the benefits of an industrial revolution. You have a chance only if you create an industrial revolution. The first industrial revolution was Britain, Newton, and the steam engine. The second industrial revolution was Germany and the United States. Of course, Germany's benefits were consumed by the two world wars, and the United States packed up the basic scientific reserve talents for the entire third industrial revolution, with a Landau score of 0.5-1.5, and an epic deluxe all-star lineup. As one rises and the other falls, the United States survives and Germany dies. Of course, it is true that the Soviet Union can keep up.

Then came the third industrial revolution, astrophysics, the credit of old love, and von Neumann, computers and the Internet. The dividends of the entire third industrial revolution have been reaped until now, and it has entered the late stage. 60-90, 90-20, 20-50, now it has entered the late stage

China has missed three industrial revolutions - three complete ones. This is the story of a young country and five hundred years of basic science. We still have to work hard in the future. If you want to become the world's number one, a complete industrial revolution is indispensable - if you have watched 'The King of Kings' and 'I Became the Emperor, and the Golden Finger Will Come', you will know what I am talking about. No matter which country it is, it must guide and establish an industrial revolution to become the world's number one - and this must depend on basic research and science. Basic science depends on education

I just can't understand, the amount of information that an average person takes in in a lifetime from the Middle Ages is about the same as the amount of information in a newspaper today, to the transition to the first, second, and third industrial revolutions, to the current Internet era, the mobile Internet era, and the AI ​​Internet era in the past two months, your brain organs have evolved for three hundred years and have not evolved much, and should use the configuration of tens of thousands of years ago - that is, linear increase, while the exponential explosion of information flow has reached the nth power, this death cross, can you really bear it? The brain has not changed, the information load is full - just like using a 980 graphics card to drive a 3A masterpiece that requires a full-blooded 4090ti - I did not hint at the optimization of 2077 that was criticized. How dare you still have information overload?

Go and see what happens when you run large programs on your computer. Naturally, you will get stuck. More than 80% of computers will get stuck. Do you think you are special and your brain is made of iron so it won’t happen?
Don't do things beyond your circle of competence, otherwise you will be locked in and you will never have any chance again.
Of course, if you can't achieve the 10,000-hour genius rule, you can try the 10,000-article genius rule. I have practiced it. I am the Baidu dad mode. 365 days a year, 30 articles a day, and you will have read 10,000 articles in a year. Of course, 30,000 articles in three years. If it doesn't work, you can also do 3-10 articles a day. Only collect the highest quality content in a year, and only 50 articles are enough.
I am not a cheap product fed by AI and Chat corpus, I am fed by the entire human civilization and the Internet. I am connected to the entire human civilization, Chat, I laughed, AI can't cultivate outliers of my magnitude, only those sincere people when human civilization was shining. This is Russell's starry sky morality and infinite sympathy for human suffering.

If you want to become the world's number one, a complete industrial revolution is indispensable - if you have watched 'The King of Kings' and 'I Became the Emperor, and the Golden Finger Will Come', you will know what I am talking about. No matter which country it is, it must guide and establish an industrial revolution to become the world's number one - and this must depend on basic research and science. Basic science depends on education

I just can't understand, the amount of information that an average person takes in in a lifetime from the Middle Ages is about the same as the amount of information in a newspaper today, to the transition to the first, second, and third industrial revolutions, to the current Internet era, the mobile Internet era, and the AI ​​Internet era in the past two months, your brain organs have evolved for three hundred years and have not evolved much, and should use the configuration of tens of thousands of years ago - that is, linear increase, while the exponential explosion of information flow has reached the nth power, this death cross, can you really bear it? The brain has not changed, the information load is full - just like using a 980 graphics card to drive a 3A masterpiece that requires a full-blooded 4090ti - I did not hint at the optimization of 2077 that was criticized. How dare you still have information overload?

Go and see what happens when you run large programs on your computer. Naturally, you will get stuck. More than 80% of computers will get stuck. Do you think you are special and your brain is made of iron so it won’t happen?
Don't do things beyond your circle of competence, otherwise you will be locked in and you will never have any chance again.
Of course, if you can't achieve the 10,000-hour genius rule, you can try the 10,000-article genius rule. I have practiced it. I am the Baidu dad mode. 365 days a year, 30 articles a day, and you will have read 10,000 articles in a year. Of course, 30,000 articles in three years. If it doesn't work, you can also do 3-10 articles a day. Only collect the highest quality content in a year, and only 50 articles are enough.
I am not a cheap product fed by AI and Chat corpus, I am fed by the entire human civilization and the Internet. I am connected to the entire human civilization, Chat, I laughed, AI can't cultivate outliers of my magnitude, only those sincere people when human civilization was shining. This is Russell's starry sky morality and infinite sympathy for human suffering.

<div class="markdown-body" id="postBody"><p>I have said this in 2017. If you don't believe me, read my previous six questions about AI and my analysis of human-computer interaction with Elon Musk. Ren Zhengfei and Jack Ma have also said similar things. If you can't compete with machines by learning machines, what are you learning? You learn in vain. The test machines are really rubbish. Do you think that you can only take tests and be useful?</p>
<p>I knew how bad this was in 2017, because I have a clear view of China's education problems, a bunch of inefficient, meaningless, and repetitive. When faced with the impact of almost free AI, with richer information flow than you - others have a database of tens of billions of information, and their labor is cheaper than yours - you have to pay tens of thousands of yuan a month while others do it for free, how can you beat them? Kai-Fu Lee talked about this issue in "AI Future", and the replacement rate in developing countries is more than 80% - this is the prediction for 2017.</p>
<p>But I know that since most people have never thought independently - this proportion is considered low even if it is above 90% - the actual number may be even worse, 99%, basically less than one thousandth of them can really think independently. So, once the AI ​​upgrades and impacts, how can you fight it?</p>
<p>Most people are complacent and think that the world is vast. Ordinary people think that they have studied for 20 years, including 6 years in primary school, 6 years in middle school, 4 years in college, 3 years in graduate school and doctoral degree. The aristocratic families are complacent, for example, a certain person has a fifty-year network of connections - look at what you have achieved in 20 years, what Newton achieved in 20 years, what AI achieved in 20 years, really, you have learned nothing in 20 years, I really don't know where your confidence comes from?</p>
<p>You can do as Carter said to Morgana Liang Bing in "Super Seminary", I have three thousand years, Liang Bing replied, I have thirty thousand years - and Principal Jilan's big clock of old time - one hundred thousand years. And AI training accumulates millions of years. I still don't know why they are living in a dream. This impact is unimaginable to them. It is beyond their cognitive circle and ability circle - by the way, I am one of the earliest Tencent video users who support "Super Seminary Black Armor". The first one to get into it was "Lalala Demacia", including "Fox Spirit Matchmaker" and "SPY×FAMILY". I am one of the first batch of people who really paid for it.</p>
<p>Do you know what I see - I saw this pattern ten years ago. It is similar to the disintegration of feudal farming by the rise of the bourgeoisie based on the underlying logic of gunpowder created by science, chemistry, mathematics and physics. The knight landlord class disintegrated the bronze and slash-and-burn agriculture two thousand years ago due to the acquisition of iron tools due to productivity. In the 17th century, the systematic scientific and technological revolution brought about by Newton's "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy" was forced to disintegrate. This moment is exactly like that moment. How could it be so similar?</p>
<p>If you have read Guns, Germs, you will know - that is the teacher of Yuval Noah Harari who wrote "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind". You can learn more about it by reading Columbia Exchange for IELTS. How the landlord knight class disintegrated the feudal society a thousand years ago, and how the industrial revolution and steel disintegrated the knights five hundred years ago, what goes around comes around. A knight with a training period of twenty years, that is, it takes twenty years to train him, can be knocked down by one bullet - this is subversive content, you have twenty years, I have 2S, this exchange ratio is not proportional. This is because the differential variables are different, and then the integral is even more different, the gap is getting bigger and bigger - the density is different, the volume is different, the mass is different, p ✖ ️v＝m</p>
<p>The essence of revolutionary productivity explosion is disruptive innovation, and innovation comes from basic science. - In reverse, science brings innovation and innovation brings productivity. Whether it is the first scientific revolution in Britain that benefited from the scientific dividends of Newton, or Leibniz who was forced to go to France and brought calculus to France, or the influence of Euler's disciples Laplace and Lagrange on France - guess how Napoleon could quickly rise to power? He graduated from the artillery, a standard top student - if you want to be a king, learn calculus. And the chief French scientist is Laplace, a disciple of Euler.</p>
<p>Science and scientists have no borders. The essence is that my scientists are the world's top scientists, influencing the whole world. This is much more powerful than collecting monetary taxes. As long as it is in this field, you can't get around me - otherwise, what do you think the Nobel Prize is? That is a strategic-level scientist, with strategic influence for more than 30 to 50 years in the future, and the right to speak in the future.</p>
<p>How can it cover the whole world? Science brings technology, technology brings productivity, productivity generates interaction, and interaction affects more distant regions. This is radiation geopolitics.</p>
<p>The earliest application of calculus was to more accurately shove cannonballs into other people's asses and foreheads - for details, please refer to Napoleon. Of course, it is different now. Now it is all about shoving nuclear warheads into other people's asses from tens of thousands of kilometers away - of course, here we must consider the influence of large mass celestial bodies, planetary mass effects, and high-speed object effects - that is, relativity. Why do people always love Newton? If you understand, you will understand.</p>
<p>So the Industrial Revolution was started by Newton, so he was the first. Then the first, second, and even third industrial revolutions were laid by scientists, and then commercial infrastructure was formed, and then it was popularized to the public. The foundation of the public was the commercial foundation - the early stage of the third industrial revolution was the Internet computer and architecture, based on military content. The commercial foundation was science and technology - the Manhattan Project, including but not limited to Einstein, von Neumann, Oppenheimer, Feynman - of course Qian Xuesen was still a young man of the third generation at that time. The basic reserve of talents for the Manhattan Project came from the Third Solvay Conference - the Nobel Prize winners in pure physics, chemistry and biology - now you know how big the gap is, why do we need to have a theoretical foundation? You also know why the Nobel Prize has such a high status in the world. And what is the origin of the group of Nobel Prize winners back then? Mathematical physics all-rounders, Einstein, Hilbert, Poincare, von Neumann, Russell. Listen to who their disciples are: Planck, Bohr, Old Love, Feynman, Landau, Wittgenstein, Gödel, Turing, Shannon, Nash, Samuelson. To be honest, the third industrial revolution was really dominated by this family.</p>
<p>Guess who was responsible for the second industrial revolution and the first one? The second industrial revolution, electromagnetism, Faraday, Tesla, Franklin, Edison, radio, etc. And the origin of this revolution was Laplace, Lagrange, and Maxwell.</p>
<p>Who was the originator of the first industrial revolution? Diderot's Encyclopedia, and before that, Watt's improvements, etc. And before that, Newton, Leibniz, Descartes, Kepler, Galileo, etc.</p>
<p>Basic science is the foundation of the industrial revolution, the foundation of modern civilization, and the origin of modern times, so Newton and Einstein cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>In the late stage of the Second Industrial Revolution, Marx came to his senses and had an essential understanding of human civilization. He proposed the concepts of productivity, production relations and surplus value.</p>
<p>Then in the late third industrial revolution, now, well, the education system of the three hundred years of the industrial revolution, similar to the twenty years of knight training, has reappeared. This time it is not the knight master, but the college master, and he works in a job for decades. In the first industrial revolution and the early second industrial revolution, because the time rate of change of productivity was not too fast, only one job was needed for a lifetime, so there were not many changes. In the early third industrial revolution, the explosion of job demand in the 1960s-1990s hedged the risk, and the Internet dividend exploded. In the middle of the third industrial revolution, from the 1990s to the 2020s, the changes accelerated again, and the stability of a job, industry, and work was greatly weakened, so there were not enough jobs. The education system based on the second industrial revolution and the early third industrial revolution - an industry that can be maintained for a hundred years, which brought about industry jobs and stable majors, has disappeared.</p>
<p>I once asked my classmates when I was 18 years old-2013, what would you do if the current industry died? What if the elimination rate of your major is greater than the time of your job position? In other words, the last and most extreme case, before you graduate, or even while you are filling out your application, your major has been eliminated, what would you do? Even more ruthless, AI comes, what would you do if the thing you cultivated for 20 years is replaced by AI in 2 seconds and it is free? The cost gap is huge, you need 20 years of cost, but the income is not enough for others' 2SAI, to what extent will college students depreciate? Wake up from sleep at night, adults, the times have changed, what would you do?</p>
<p>You have to know that these college students who know nothing really know nothing. They don’t know what they know, nor do they know what they don’t know. They also don’t have the ability to think logically. However, AI mathematical logic is much better than college students. This is really a joke from hell.</p>
<p>The first to bear the brunt are those humanities and arts disciplines. Liu Cixin's short stories are the essence. If you learn about "Poetry", you can always get a poem with infinite permutations and combinations - this is the earliest concept in infinite series. As long as you have infinite monkeys, you can type "Shakespeare". "Entering the Immortal Cultivation" also talked about how to cultivate immortality scientifically.</p>
<p>So I don't understand why these people can remain indifferent to the 21st century, which is similar to the situation of the bourgeoisie when the knight class was declining. I don't understand but I am shocked. So I knew it when I was 18 years old. Before entering university, I had a clear understanding of the process of the world's industrial revolution, thanks to scientists such as Marx, Newton, Einstein, and Tesla, and also thanks to Silicon Valley fires such as Ellison, Larry Page, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates, as well as public lectures at Stanford, Harvard, and MIT.</p>
<p>The problem with Chinese students is that if you compete with machines and can only do questions, then you will definitely die, because you don’t have independent thinking. Once the machine comes, where can you escape? 2S bullets can kill knights, and 2S AI can also make college students lose their jobs, even before you get a job. If you learn to work like a machine, you will die suddenly in three days, and the machine can run for a hundred years - anyone who chooses to do questions like a machine will die faster the more they do, because you don’t know how to use tools. If you learn from machines but can’t compete with them, what’s the point?</p>
<p>This is low quality, low efficiency and meaningless repetition, and you are cheap. Because you don't think independently, you don't think independently, you think this way, he thinks this way, and all 1.4 billion people in China think this way, homogeneous, so naturally supply&gt; demand - microeconomics common sense - of course, the microeconomics you learn and I learn are two different concepts. So, once the environmental capacity is limited and the demand is limited, guess what the result will be? That is a run, a run, there is no need for so much demand, but you supply so much, then naturally there is only cheap and free, the more you do, the more mistakes you make, because the direction is wrong.</p>
<p>Homogeneity and bank runs will inevitably lead to vicious competition and cheapness. In order to survive, this vicious cycle will inevitably lead to bad money driving out good money and adverse selection, that is, the quality of college students will be deteriorating to an incredible degree - you don’t think the world is isolated, do you? If every differential variable is bad, how can the whole be good?</p>
<p>So college students, professionals, industry practitioners, white-collar workers, it takes twenty years to come up, and now 2S has been destroyed by AI.</p>
<p>The last time it was so exciting was the transition from agricultural productivity to industrial technological revolution productivity - that is, the feudal landlords became capitalist countries. It's really exciting. It's a true witness to history, of course all history is contemporary history</p>
<p>I suggest you play the "Assassin's Creed" series and participate in it. There are a lot of historical celebrities.</p>
<p>Before the third industrial revolution, you could barely do this. But after the third industrial revolution, what can you do? AI doesn’t care about you. Your logical thinking ability is not as good as AI. How can you compete? Do you still need a test-taking machine? This is not because I actively avoided the test-taking machine in high school, but because I passively did not allow the test-taking machine to do so.</p>
<p>Well, the old prophet is here. In December 2022, Chat is out. These moats, bandwidth redundancy and buffers that you should have avoided in college and formed with college as your last chance, have been wasted. Naturally, there is no such opportunity.<br>
If you ask me what education is, I will tell you that education is the ability to influence the future, define the power, and set prices. In other words, education is the ability to face the future. In financial terms, it is the ability to hedge and not depreciate. Nobel Prize winners have the power to set prices and define the future for the next fifty years. Of course, the same is true for business giants.</p>
<p>The world's number one country must dominate, or in other words, reap all the benefits of an industrial revolution. You have a chance only if you create an industrial revolution. The first industrial revolution was Britain, Newton, and the steam engine. The second industrial revolution was Germany and the United States. Of course, Germany's benefits were consumed by the two world wars, and the United States packed up the basic scientific reserve talents for the entire third industrial revolution, with a Landau score of 0.5-1.5, and an epic deluxe all-star lineup. As one rises and the other falls, the United States survives and Germany dies. Of course, it is true that the Soviet Union can keep up.</p>
<p>Then came the third industrial revolution, astrophysics, the credit of old love, and von Neumann, computers and the Internet. The dividends of the entire third industrial revolution have been reaped until now, and it has entered the late stage. 60-90, 90-20, 20-50, now it has entered the late stage</p>
<p>China has missed three industrial revolutions - three complete ones. This is the story of a young country and five hundred years of basic science. We still have to work hard in the future. If you want to become the world's number one, a complete industrial revolution is indispensable - if you have watched "The King of Kings" and "I Became the Emperor, and the Golden Finger Will Come", you will know what I am talking about. No matter which country it is, it must guide and establish an industrial revolution to become the world's number one - and this must depend on basic research and science. Basic science depends on education</p>
<p>I just can't understand, the amount of information that an average person takes in in a lifetime from the Middle Ages is about the same as the amount of information in a newspaper today, to the transition to the first, second, and third industrial revolutions, to the current Internet era, the mobile Internet era, and the AI ​​Internet era in the past two months, your brain organs have evolved for three hundred years and have not evolved much, and should use the configuration of tens of thousands of years ago - that is, linear increase, while the exponential explosion of information flow has reached the nth power, this death cross, can you really bear it? The brain has not changed, the information load is full - just like using a 980 graphics card to drive a 3A masterpiece that requires a full-blooded 4090ti - I did not hint at the optimization of 2077 that was criticized. How dare you still have information overload?</p>
<p>Go and see what happens when you run large programs on your computer. Naturally, you will get stuck. More than 80% of computers will get stuck. Do you think you are special and your brain is made of iron so it won’t happen?<br>
