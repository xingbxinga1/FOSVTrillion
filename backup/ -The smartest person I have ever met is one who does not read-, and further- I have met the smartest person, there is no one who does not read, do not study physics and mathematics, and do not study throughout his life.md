The smartest people must study physics and mathematics. By the way, the origin of physics and mathematics of the big guys-in fact, physics and mathematics are not separated. Mathematics is the underlying logic of physics. The two are twin symbiotic relationships. There is no physics and mathematics. Physics without mathematics is meaningless.

Mathematics and physics are symbiotic, from Aristotle, Euclid, Archimedes, to Pascal, Descartes, Galileo, Copernicus, to Newton, Leibniz, Hooke, Halley, etc. People, to people like Euler, Lagrange and Laplace, to people like Cosy Gauss, Galois, Abel Riemann, to people like Möbius Klein, Hilbert Poincaré, Einstein von Neumann People like Yiman, mathematics and physics all coexist
And what I will talk about next is not pure physics and mathematics, but the big guys based on the integration of mathematics and physics, physics - business. In fact, physics and business are also symbiotic relationships. What is worth celebrating is that my first instinct when learning physics was this, and I am self-taught

The big guy’s synthetic formula is bound to drop out of school—Munger has to go to school many times, and he must accept the direct influence of another group of top big shots—Einstein, Feng Nuoyi, Franklin, they must learn physics and mathematics, and they must learn by themselves. Well, the foundation of the boss is ready.

Synthetic formula, influenced by another group of bosses × dropping out of school for many times × self-study × physics and mathematics

Charlie Munger, my favorite, also dropped out of school several times without completing his degree. However, he majored in mathematics at the advanced University of Michigan, and then was attracted to physics - Einstein was his guide, and then entered the university during World War II. Caltech - yes, the one you know. He and Qian Xuesen are alumni. He studied thermodynamics and meteorology - yes, one of von Neumann's main subjects, one of the founders of complex subjects, chaotic systems and Second law of thermodynamics. Then there's Harvard Law School

I still say the same thing, you don't even know what the bosses have gone through, but he can be directly educated by Einstein, von Neumann, and quantum sender Landau Feynman! And he was definitely the first to come into contact with complex science and business enlightenment, so he was very handy. This is a typical "outlier" person
As for economics, he was one of the earliest readers of "Mankiw Economics" and grew up after reading this economics for decades, although it was more academic.

Then let’s talk about Bezos. Bezos is a physics major, and his classmates are all physics masters. These people all have a Langdao score of about 2.5, and their goal is to pursue the Nobel Prize level, which is the Langdao score of 1.5. Bezos couldn't beat people, so he defined the boundaries of his circle of competence and changed his major. I still say the same thing, it's more important for you to know the boundaries of your circle of competence than how many abilities you have. Then he may not necessarily become the top in physics, but he still has physics thinking.

Then talk about Larry Ellison, the first principle and Feynman learning method are not the first to be used by Elon Musk, Charlie Munger's extraordinary rationality is the earliest, and then Larry Ellison, Bill Gate tz. Larry Ellison is truly self-taught, as can be seen from his several dropouts, but he must have iterated on his own learning, and his learning efficiency is extremely high. As long as you don't have a hat in your heart, you can surpass Stanford, Harvard, Yale, Oxford and Cambridge. This is the real path. Stanford and Harvard are just qualified to enter this path.

Then there is Elon Musk. Others are really masters of physics. Just ask SpaceX and Tesla and you will know. Don't repeat it. But the essence of it is not the first principle - I knew that thing 20 years ago. At that time, we called it the first driving force, and it was so hard to throw up. What I want to say is what he said, you can violate the law, humanities and other man-made content, because people can violate it, but you cannot violate the laws of physics, because nature cannot violate it. This sentence is equivalent to Charlie Munger's bounded rationality-this is why neither Munger nor I like the academic school of economics, and it is also equivalent to the first principle-the first driving force, which is also equivalent to Marx's practical philosophy and seeking truth from facts and following objective laws

Let’s talk about Musk again, which will be explained in detail later in Silicon Valley Fire. Like Larry Ellison, Bill Gates, Bezos, and Larry Page, he was deeply affected by the fire of Silicon Valley and Bell Labs. So who influenced Bell Labs? Engineer culture. So who influenced Bell Labs? The group of Nobel Prize winners in physics, and they came from Turing Shannon Feynman and others, and Turing Shannon Feynman was influenced by von Neumann, Einstein, von Neumann Einstein, they were influenced by Hill Bert, Poincaré, this is the legacy

And the important thing to mention is Tesla. Tesla is an engineer and creator. He directly influenced Elon Musk - just like Franklin and Charlie Munger. Turing and Newton influenced Jobs. The same, so the bigwigs are passed down from generation to generation. Silicon Valley can be seen as an emergence mechanism cultivated by a group of environmental soils with Langdao scores of 0.5-1.5 - which is much more difficult than chaos.

The relationship is probably like this. So, where is our heritage? Where are we? Do our smartest people study physics, mathematics, and computers?
This horse is inherited from the seventh generation, and now it has reached the seventh generation, which is Elon Musk at the level of Naruto.
Of course, I inherited Munger’s content.
